We have a few simple steps we need you to fill before you get started:

2) Create an application and decide what attributes you would like the end user to share - see screenshot.

3) Upload the plugin and input the details below with are available on your dashboard:

	-Yoti App ID - which is the unique identifier for your specific application.
	-Yoti Scenario ID: Used to render the inline QR code.
	-Yoti SDK ID - which is the SDK identifier generated by Yoti Dashboard in the Key 			tab when you create your app. Note this is not your Application 				Identifier which is needed by your client-side code.
	-Yoti PEM File - which is the application pem file. It can be downloaded only once 	from the Keys tab in your Yoti Dashboard.

4) Once this is completed you can move your Yoti widget to where appropriate on your site.
