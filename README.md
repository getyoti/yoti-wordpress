## An Architectural view

Before you start your integration, here is a bit of background on how the integration works. To integrate your application with Yoti, your back-end must expose a GET endpoint that Yoti will use to forward tokens.
The endpoint can be configured in the Yoti Dashboard when you create/update your application. For more information on how to create an application please check our [developer page](https://www.yoti.com/developers/documentation/#login-button-setup).

The image below shows how your application back-end and Yoti integrate into the context of a Login flow.
Yoti SDK carries out for you steps 6, 7 and the profile decryption in step 8.

Yoti also allows you to enable user details verification from your mobile app by means of the Android (TBA) and iOS (TBA) SDKs. In that scenario, your Yoti-enabled mobile app is playing both the role of the browser and the Yoti app. Your back-end doesn't need to handle these cases in a significantly different way. You might just decide to handle the `User-Agent` header in order to provide different responses for desktop and mobile clients.

## Requirements

This SDK works with the WordPress business plan package.

## Installing the SDK

To import the Yoti SDK inside your project:
1) Log on to the admin console of your Wordpress website. e.g. Https://www.wordpressurl.org.uk/wp-admin
2) Navigate to at `Plugins > Add New`.
3) Search for Yoti and install and activate the plug in.

## Plugin Setup

To set things up, navigate on WordPress to `Settings > Yoti Connect`.
 
 Here you will be asked to add the following information:
 
Yoti App ID

Yoti SDK ID

Yoti PEM File

Where:
- `Yoti SDK ID` is the SDK identifier generated by Yoti Dashboard in the Key tab when you create your app. Note this is not your Application Identifier which is needed by your client-side code.

- `Yoti PEM File` is the application pem file. It can be downloaded only once from the Keys tab in your Yoti Dashboard.

- `Yoti App ID` is unique identifier for your specific application.

Please do not open the pem file as this might corrupt the key and you will need to create a new application.

## Setting up your Yoti Application

Specify the basic details of your application such as the name, description and optional logo. These details can be whatever you like and will not affect the plugins functionality.

The `Data` tab - Specify any attributes you like, at this time, you must choose at least one. It is recommend you choose `Given Name(s)`, `Family Name` and `Email Address` at a minimum, if you plan to allow new user registrations.

The `Integration` tab - Here is where you specify the callback URL. This is found on your WordPress settings page. __NOTE__: If you get redirected to your WordPress frontpage instead of the Admin area, simply add `/wp-admin` to the URL.

## Allowing new registrations
 
By default, this is not enabled for security. Ticking the box and saving your changes allows a new user to Register and Log in by using thier Yoti. 
 
A new user who registeres this way will be set to the `Subscriber` role in WordPress.
 
If left disabled, if a new user tries to scan the Yoti QR code, they will be redirected back to the login page with an error message displayed.

 ## Linking existing accounts to use Yoti authentication

To allow your existing users to log in using Yoti instead of entering thier username/password combination, they must:

1) Log in as normal into WordPress
2) Navigate to `Users > Your Profile`
3) Scroll down to `Yoti Profile`
4) Click on the `Link account to Yoti` button
5) Scan the QR code and allow the share request

The User is now linked to Yoti authentication, at the log in screen they can click `Log in with Yoti`, scan the QR code, and they will be logged in.
