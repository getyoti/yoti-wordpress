## An Architectural view

Before you start your integration, here is a bit of background on how the integration works. To integrate your application with Yoti, your back-end must expose a GET endpoint that Yoti will use to forward tokens.
The endpoint can be configured in the Yoti Dashboard when you create/update your application. For more information on how to create an application please check our [developer page](https://www.yoti.com/developers/documentation/#login-button-setup).

The image below shows how your application back-end and Yoti integrate into the context of a Login flow.
Yoti SDK carries out for you steps 6, 7 and the profile decryption in step 8.

Yoti also allows you to enable user details verification from your mobile app by means of the Android (TBA) and iOS (TBA) SDKs. In that scenario, your Yoti-enabled mobile app is playing both the role of the browser and the Yoti app. Your back-end doesn't need to handle these cases in a significantly different way. You might just decide to handle the `User-Agent` header in order to provide different responses for desktop and mobile clients.

## Requirements

This SDK works with the WordPress business plan package.

## Installing the SDK

To import the Yoti SDK inside your project, log on to the admin console of your Wordpress website. Navigate to Plugins and click add new. Search for Yoti and install and activate the plug in.

Go to Settings and click Yoti connect, here add your SDK ID, APP ID and PEM file which is created via your Yoti Dashboard.

Where:
- `sdkID` is the SDK identifier generated by Yoti Dashboard in the Key tab when you create your app. Note this is not your Application Identifier which is needed by your client-side code.

- `path/to/your-application-pem-file.pem` is the path to the application pem file. It can be downloaded only once from the Keys tab in your Yoti Dashboard.

- `application ID` is unique identifier for your specific application.

Please do not open the pem file as this might corrupt the key and you will need to create a new application.

# Profile retrieval
When your application receives a token via the exposed endpoint (it will be assigned to a query string parameter named `token`), you can easily retrieve the user profile by adding the following to your endpoint handler:

```php
$yotiClient = new YotiClient($config['yoti_sdk_id'], $config['yoti_pem']['contents']);
$yotiClient->setMockRequests(self::mockRequests());
$activityDetails = $yotiClient->getActivityDetails($token);
```
Before you inspect the user profile, you might want to check whether the user validation was successful.
This is done as follows:

```javascript
$activityDetails = $yotiClient->getActivityDetails($token);
if ($yotiClient->getOutcome() == YotiClient::OUTCOME_SUCCESS)
{
	//handle happy path
} else {
	//handle unhappy path
}
```

## Handling users

When you retrieve the user profile, you receive a userId generated by Yoti exclusively for your application.
This means that if the same individual logs into another app, Yoti will assign her/him a different id.
You can use such id to verify whether the retrieved profile identifies a new or an existing user.
Here is an example of how this works:

```php
 // check if yoti user exists
$userId = $this->getUserIdByYotiId($activityDetails->getUserId());
if (!$userId)
{
	// handle registration
} else {
	// handle unhappy path
}
```
